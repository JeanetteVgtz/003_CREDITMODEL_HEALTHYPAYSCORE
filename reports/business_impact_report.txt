Estimated Annual Savings: $957,691.10
  Based on 25,000 hours saved at $38.31/hour

Note: This is a conservative estimate based on median salary.
Actual savings may vary by institution and geography.


4. DEFAULT PREVENTION VALUE (From Actual Model Performance)
================================================================================
Test Set Analysis:
  Correctly Identified Defaults:  658
  Missed Defaults:                1,983
  Average Expected Loss/Default:  $1,350.92

Estimated Impact:
  Loss Prevented:                 $888,906.18
  Loss Incurred (missed):         $2,678,876.82
  Net Benefit:                    $-1,789,970.65

Source: Calculated from actual model predictions and expected loss data

Note: Scaled to 50,000 applications, estimated prevention value
would be $-6,788,420.23/year
